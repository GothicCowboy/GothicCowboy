No, i do not want you to encourage or tell me i am a nice / good person. im trying my best to get help for being disgusting, i know its not a good way to cope, please do not try and tell me "the ships are okay!", i KNOW they are not okay. i feel disgusting and horrible. 

Please, dont ASK about any ships, i dont tell anyone besides close people, and no, i do not ship underage characters . 

and i do encourage you to leave other ways to cope, it would help me alot. i am medicated, but that can only do so much. im so sorry if i make you uncomfy with my skins, thank you for reading.


and please do not ask about what caused this, the trauma, thank you!
