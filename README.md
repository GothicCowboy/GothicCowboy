Taken, > @Stipsl <3. Check strawpage for more about me, i change my github/main kin alot, so dont worry about that lol. <p align="right"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=GothicCowboy&color=e17c0b&abbreviated=true"/> 




















I do not ship underage characters, or siblings. i do not like lolis or shotas. i do not support/like endo systems, but i will respect and not mention that in convo if you are one.

do not encourage my ships, do not encourage darkshipping around me, im trying to heal. i AM mentally ill, i know this.


Please be aware i take meds and sometimes get intoxicated, i may act strange. 


reffering to any drama, i do not want to talk about it. if a friend starts something, then im sorry, but im blocking you. i cannot do this anymore, i cannot DEAL with the amount of drama everyone keeps trying to start. i can forgive and forget, but at some point its a loss cause. Yes, i have forgiven old friends i had drama with, thats HEALTHY. if you have drama with someone i forgave, and we are friends, thats YOUR issue, not mine. you cannot choose who someone is friends with, you cannot choose which side someone chooses. 


And as a darkshipper i CAN heal and i CAN be a darkshipper without being a proshipper. just because im one thing doesnt mean im the other, I can support something and not support something similar. i dont HAVE to change that for you, friend or not. ill be respective and nice, but im not going to support that ship or what you are doing. im very against anything sexual that includes minors, fiction or not.

Im against anything including incest, i have severe trauma related to this. 

Again, i will be friends with you even if you are a proshipper, but the moment something happens im going to call you out, or block you. friendship is supposed to be healthy, fighting constantly is NOT healthy.
