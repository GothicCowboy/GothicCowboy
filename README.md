I do not ship underage characters, or siblings. i do not like lolis or shotas. i do not support/like endo systems, but i will respect and not mention that in convo if you are one.

do not encourage my ships, do not encourage darkshipping around me, im trying to heal. i AM mentally ill, i know this.





reffering to any drama, i do not want to talk about it. if a friend starts something, then im sorry, but im blocking you. i cannot do this anymore, i cannot DEAL with the amount of drama everyone keeps trying to start. i can forgive and forget, but at some point its a loss cause. Yes, i have forgiven old friends i had drama with, thats HEALTHY. if you have drama with someone i forgave, and we are friends, thats YOUR issue, not mine. you cannot choose who someone is friends with, you cannot choose whos side someone chooses.
